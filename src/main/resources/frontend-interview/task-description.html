<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  Welcome to our frontend developer task. We believe in assessing your coding skills by giving you the opportunity to showcase your abilities through practical application. This task aims to understand your coding style and will serve as a foundation for further discussions during the interview. Remember, there's no right or wrong solution; we're interested in your approach to problem-solving.
</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>
  The objective of this task is to create a frontend application that seamlessly integrates with the provided backend API to enable file uploads and management.
</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The application shows available images</li>
  <li>Each image must be represented by a thumbnail, as well as it's name and size</li>
  <li>The application shall include a file upload triggered by a button (standard behavior)</li>
  <li>Multiple file upload shall be possible</li>
  <li>File upload progress is shown in some way (numbers, percentage, progress bar, ...)</li>
  <li>File upload status is visible (error or success)</li>
  <li>Provide the source code of the frontend application along with any necessary instructions for running the application locally.</li>
 </ul>
<h2>Bonus (extra credit)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Drag-and-drop file upload</li>
  <li>Test coverage >80%</li>
  <li>Responsive design</li>
  <li>Pagination (endpoint <code>/api/v1/filepage/{number}</code>)</li>
  <li>Include any additional documentation or notes relevant to the implementation</li>
</ul>

<h2>Constraints</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Use Angular 14+ for frontend development.</li>
  <li>You are free to choose any styling library/framework of your choice for UI design (e.g., Bootstrap, Material Design).</li>
  <li>Ensure compatibility with modern web browsers.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Examples</h2>

<h3>Getting data about files</h3>
<p>To get a list of files, you can use one the following endpoints</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>/api/v1/files</code> - gets a list of all files</li>
  <li><code>/api/v1/files/{id}</code> - gets a list of all articles separated in pages</li>
</ul>

<p>
  To get a thumbnail of a desired size, you can use the parameter <bold>size</bold> on the <code>/api/v1/files/{id}</code>.
  For example <code>size=100</code> will return a thumbnail of max size 100x100px.
</p>
<h3>Uploading a file</h3>
<p>To upload a file, you can use the following endpoint:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>/api/v1/files</code> - POST request as multipart file</li>
</ul>

<h3>Additional information</h3>
<p>Please note that the REST endpoint enables only a single file upload - you will have to implement the multiple file upload with angular!</p>
<p>All files are supported, but thumbnails are generated only for JPEG (JPG), PNG and GIF</p>
<p>Max upload file size is: 5MB</p>
