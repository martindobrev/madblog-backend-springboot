<h1>Welcome to our Frontend Developer Task</h1>

<h3>Why a programming task?</h3>
<p>
  In order to get an impression of your coding skills we are asking you to do what you do best - write some code. Solving the following task will give us a basic understanding of your style and will be used as a basis for further questions and open technical discussion.
  There is no right or wrong solution, we just want to see how you will approach the problem.
</p>

<h3>The Task</h3>
<p>
  Create an angular file manager application with the following features:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The file manager shows available images</li>
  <li>Each image must be represented by a thumbnail, as well as it's name and size</li>
  <li>The file manager shall include a file upload area, that is triggered either by a button (standard behavior) or directly by dran-and-dropping files</li>
  <li>Multiple file upload shall be possible</li>
  <li>File upload progress is shown in some way (numbers, percentage, progress bar, ...)</li>
  <li>File upload status is visible (error or success)</li>
 </ul>

<h3>Technical Requirements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Angular 14+</li>
  <li>UI library of your choice (or custom CSS)</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>


<h3>Instructions</h3>

<h5>Getting data about files</h5>
<p>To get a list of files, you can use one the following endpoints</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>/api/v1/files</code> - gets a list of all files</li>
  <li><code>/api/v1/files/{id}</code> - gets a list of all articles separated in pages</li>
</ul>

<p>
  To get a thumbnail of a desired size, you can use the parameter <bold>size</bold> on the <code>/api/v1/files/{id}</code>.
  For example size=100 will return a thumbnail of max size 100x100px.
</p>
<h5>Uploading a file</h5>
<p>To upload a file, you can use the following endpoint:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>/api/v1/files</code> - POST request as multipart file</li>
  <li>The file must be </li>
</ul>

<h5>Additional information</h5>
<p>Please note that the REST endpoint enables only a single file upload - you will have to implement the multiple file upload with angular!</p>
<p>Supported file types are: PNG, JPEG, GIF and PDF (for documents)</p>
<p>Max upload file size is: 5MB</p>
